The ps command in Linux is a powerful tool that allows you to view information about the processes running on your Linux system. It stands for “process status” and it's a command that you can use from the command line to get information about the currently running processes.


The ` top` command is a built-in utility in Linux that provides a real-time, dynamic view of the system's performance. It displays information about CPU usage, memory usage, running processes, and more, allowing users to monitor and analyze system activity effectively.


The 'kill' command in Linux is used to send a signal to a process, typically to terminate it. You can use it by specifying the Process ID (PID) of the process you want to terminate, like this: kill 1234 .
