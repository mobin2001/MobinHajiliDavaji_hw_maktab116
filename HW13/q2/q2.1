The major feature that differentiates HTTP/2 from HTTP/1.1 is the binary framing layer.
Unlike HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 uses a binary framing layer.
This layer encapsulates messages – converted to its binary equivalent – while making sure that its
HTTP semantics (method details, header information, etc.) remain untamed.
This feature of HTTP/2 enables gRPC to use lesser resources.
